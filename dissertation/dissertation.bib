abstract="Providing high availability and the ability to share data despite the weak connectivity of mobile computing raises the problem of trusting replicated data servers that may be corrupt. This is because servers must be run on portable computers, and these machines are less secure and thus less trustworthy than those traditionally used to run servers. We describe the kinds of problems one must be prepared to deal with, noting that even users of secured, non‚Äêportable computers are at risk if servers trust all authorized peers. We show that high availability through data replication on portable computers need not be mutually exclusive with various levels of data security one might want. We give three solutions to this trust problem for a simple example architecture, achieving progressively higher levels of security with progressively higher costs. We then show how to solve this trust problem for the more complex architecture of Bayou, a weakly consistent replicated data system we built at Xerox PARC.",

year = {2001},
month = {December},
abstract = {At the PODC 2001 conference, I got tired of everyone saying how difficult it was to understand the Paxos algorithm, published in [122]. Although people got so hung up in the pseudo-Greek names that they found the paper hard to understand, the algorithm itself is very simple. So, I cornered a couple of people at the conference and explained the algorithm to them orally, with no paper. When I got home, I wrote down the explanation as a short note, which I later revised based on comments from Fred Schneider and Butler Lampson. The current version is 13 pages long, and contains no formula more complicated than n1 &gt; n2.},
